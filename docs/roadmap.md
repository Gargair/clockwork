# Roadmap

- Multi-user support with authentication
- Reporting and analytics (daily/weekly summaries, per-category totals)
- Data export/import (CSV/JSON)
- Integrations (issue trackers, calendars)
- Offline-friendly client
- Role-based access control (post multi-user)

## Post-initial release polish

- Adopt Tailwind CSS for styling to standardize design tokens, speed up UI development, and reduce custom CSS surface area. Gradually migrate existing styles, starting with layout and common components.
