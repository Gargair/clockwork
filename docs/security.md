# Security and privacy

## MVP considerations
- Single-user mode may skip authentication; do not expose publicly without safeguards
- Validate inputs and enforce project/category relationships

## Future work
- Multi-user support with authentication and authorization
- Data protection, encryption at rest/in transit where applicable
